### Re-capping fetch

Today you're gonna work with `fetch`, again. This time to fetch tweets

Work with this endpoint:

http://kea-alt-del.dk/twitter/api/

It takes two additional parameters

`?count=50` (up to 100)

`?hashtag=word` which fetches tweets with a certain hastag

Use it to output some div's with some interesting tweets. Be creative
